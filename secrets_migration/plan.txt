The goal is to have a minimal product that will migrate all secrets from one aws account to another
Create a helper class that stores the SM data fetched from the client
* Helper class should be able to have a method that makes the secret readable if required
Create a minimal api that can:
* create secret
* list secrets
* get secret
* delete secret

Create sm client that does the following:
* takes two accounts one the account being migrated to (primary (current) , secondary (new))
* has a dict of two instances of secret manager with aws profiles of the two accounts
* make secondary account optional
* All methods can have an option to choose an account but unless specified all methods will be done on the primary account
client will do the following:

* get secrets:

* Gets all secrets including their actual secret details and returns a list of said secrets in form of helper classes (May need multiple methods to do this)
* Gets an individual secret if needed
* Creates a secret
* Validate permissions for accounts (read, write, delete)
* Migrates secret from primary to secondary 
* Bulk migrate secret from primary to secondary

All methods must have tests to validate they work as expected
